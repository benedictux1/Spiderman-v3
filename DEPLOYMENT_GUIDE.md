# Kith Platform - Render Deployment Guide

## ðŸš€ Your Kith Platform is Ready for Deployment!

All code has been pushed to GitHub and is ready for deployment on Render.

## ðŸ“‹ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Connect GitHub Repository to Render

1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com) and log into your account
2. Click "New +" â†’ "Blueprint"
3. Connect your GitHub account and select the `kith-platform` repository
4. Render will automatically detect the `render.yaml` file

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

In the Render dashboard, you need to set these environment variables for the `kith-platform` service:

#### Required API Keys
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=[Your OpenAI API Key from previous messages]
```

#### AWS S3 Configuration
```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=[Your AWS Access Key from previous messages]
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=[Your AWS Secret Key from previous messages]
S3_BUCKET_NAME=spiderman-v3-bucket1
AWS_REGION=ap-southeast-1
```

#### Google Cloud Credentials (for Gemini API)
```
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_JSON=[Your complete Google Cloud JSON from previous messages]
```

#### Admin Dashboard Authentication
```
FLASK_SECRET_KEY=[Generate a secure random string for session management]
```

**Note**: Use the exact credentials you provided earlier in our conversation. For FLASK_SECRET_KEY, you can generate a secure random string using: `python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"`

### Step 3: Deploy

1. Click "Create" in Render
2. Render will automatically:
   - Build your application using the requirements.txt
   - Start the application with Gunicorn
   - Connect to your PostgreSQL database
   - Set up health monitoring

### Step 4: Monitor Deployment

- Watch the build logs in Render dashboard
- The deployment should complete in 5-10 minutes
- Health check endpoint: `https://your-app-url.onrender.com/health`
