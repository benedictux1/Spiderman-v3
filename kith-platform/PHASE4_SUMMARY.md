## üîß Technical Implementation

### Analytics Engine
```python
# Health Score Calculation
health_score = (recency_score * 0.3 + 
               engagement_score * 0.3 + 
               quality_score * 0.2 + 
               diversity_score * 0.2)

# Trend Analysis
weekly_data = defaultdict(lambda: {"count": 0, "categories": [], "confidence": []})

# Network Insights
avg_health = sum(health_scores) / len(health_scores)
strong_relationships = len([s for s in health_scores if s >= 70])
```

### Calendar Integration
```python
# Date/Time Extraction Patterns
patterns = [
    r'tomorrow\s+(?:at\s+)?(\d{1,2})(?::(\d{2}))?\s*(am|pm)?',
    r'next\s+week\s+(?:on\s+)?(monday|tuesday|wednesday|thursday|friday|saturday|sunday)',
    r'next\s+month\s+(?:on\s+the\s+)?(\d{1,2})(?:st|nd|rd|th)?',
    # ... more patterns
]

# Event Creation
event = {
    'title': f"Follow up with {contact_name}",
    'description': summary,
    'date': date_time_info['date'],
    'time': date_time_info['time'],
    'confidence': date_time_info.get('confidence', 'low')
}
```

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Analytics Usage
```bash
# Get relationship health for a contact
curl http://localhost:5001/api/analytics/contact/1/health

# Get relationship trends
curl http://localhost:5001/api/analytics/contact/1/trends?days=90

# Get personalized recommendations
curl http://localhost:5001/api/analytics/contact/1/recommendations

# Get network insights
curl http://localhost:5001/api/analytics/network
```

### Calendar Integration
```bash
# Get upcoming events
curl http://localhost:5001/api/calendar/events?days=30

# Create events from actionable items
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/calendar/create-from-actionable \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"contact_id": 1}'

# Extract date/time from text
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/calendar/extract-datetime \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "tomorrow at 3pm"}'
```

### Python Module Usage
```python
# Analytics
from analytics import RelationshipAnalytics
analytics = RelationshipAnalytics()
health_data = analytics.calculate_relationship_health_score(contact_id)
recommendations = analytics.get_actionable_recommendations(contact_id)

# Calendar Integration
from calendar_integration import CalendarIntegration
calendar = CalendarIntegration()
date_time_info = calendar.extract_date_time_from_text("tomorrow at 3pm")
events = calendar.create_events_from_entries(entries)
